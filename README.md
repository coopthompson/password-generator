# password-generator
This is a random password generator that I built 

PSUEDOCODE:
Create a slider that effects how long the password will be 
Create a display above the slider to show the length of the password 
Take a random character from each possible character on the qwerty keyboard and combine them with +
Do this in a for loop as many times as the length of the password
spit the password back at them when the desired length is chosen

POTENTIAL FEATURES IN FUTURE:
full use of a webpage complete with styling
save the password to a clipboard button 
save the password to google? or create a chrome plugin or something
